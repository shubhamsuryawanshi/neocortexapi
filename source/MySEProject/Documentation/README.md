As part of this project new Unit Tests were designed for HomeostaticPlasticityController class.
There were no tests previously implemented for the class. A new Unit Test Class [HomeostaticPlasticityControllerTests](https://github.com/shubhamsuryawanshi/neocortexapi/blob/shubham/source/UnitTestsProject/HomeostaticPlasticityControllerTests.cs) was created in the existing project 'UnitTestsProject' of the [Neocortex](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi) API. Please refer to the [Project Report](https://github.com/shubhamsuryawanshi/neocortexapi/blob/shubham/source/MySEProject/Documentation/Report.docx) for a detailed walkthrough of every Unit Test implemented in this Unit Test Class.

Following image is the Unit Test Run Result of these new HomeostaticPlasticityController Unit Tests.
